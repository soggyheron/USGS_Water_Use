Summary of USGS Water-Use statistics for US counties from 1985 to 2015.

All volume flux units in km3/year, population in persons

Target fields are Population and TotalUses for each category of Domestic, Industrial, Livestock, and Irrigation.
Several fields need to be calculated from other fields for specific years.

Population, DomesticSelf Supply, Domestic Self Supply population, Public Supply population, PublicSupply Use, Industrial Self Supply, Irrigation Total Use, ande Livestock Total Use are all read directly from USGS tables.

Domestic Total Use:
2005,2010, 2015: Read directly
1985,1990,1995: sum of total domestic and total commercial. [1]
2000: Domsetic Self Supply + <calculated> Domestic Public Delivered

Domestic Public Delivered:
1985,1990,1995,2005,2010,2015: Read directly
2000: ( Public Supply Pop (2000) * ( PublicSupplyUse (1995)+PublicSupplyUse (2005))/(PublicSupplyPop(1995)+PublicSupplyPop(2005)))  [2]

Industrial Total Use:
1985,1990,1995: Read directly
2000, 2005, 2010, 2015: Industrial Self Supply + max(Public Supply Use - Domestic Public Delivered, 0.0)

Notes:
[1] - The commercial classification stopped in 2000.  I've assumed that commercial is best suited to be considered domestic supply, as this water will most often need to meet drinking water quality standards, whereas some industrial uses may have lower water quality standards.  By grouping the uses such, some counties show non-smooth trends in both Domestic and Industrial water uses suggesting that this assumption is not uniformly valid in all counties.
